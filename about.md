## About me 

## I am Lojayne Ahmed Diab and I live between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia  Immediately after my graduation, I taught programming to children in different institutes and helped them build smart games and autonomous cars through Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I also helped engineering students with their graduation projects, and I also gave free courses in private universities on the introduction of artificial intelligence after I finished the online artificial intelligence courses. I work as a programmer in Electronics City and have checked and modified existing software developed using C++ and java. I helped debug programs developed by young programmers and remove bugs. The company's clientele increased by 85% and that's why I was hired to train and supervise new employees. Although I am the youngest employee in the company. Regarding my career plan, I would like to continue my progress Experience in artificial intelligence. My main goal is to work with (SCAI) (Saudi Company for Artificial Intelligence) and I feel MSc AI will give me Key skills required for a role within this organization.  As you can see from my previous experience, I am a programmer. An individual with a strong desire to succeed.
